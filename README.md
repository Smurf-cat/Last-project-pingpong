# Last-project-pingpong


My game uses a rather clever system of moving the paddles that bounce the ball by changing their X and Y coords.
The ball system i have still yet to understand but im gessing my great and appreciative teacher will help me with that.
I will add a pinch of comedy in forms of: Funny background and random loss messages.
